# TODO.txt

Milestone I: get pictures to list themselves into the main dynamic gallery.

Milestone II: get thumbnails to follow on a per-index basis.

I:
-> use templating and ensure that the linking matches the "page type" (Which should be implicit to the view/model).

II:
-> Use technique from I and change the gallery setting.

Afterwards, I still need to implement csrf.

I would also like to finish some more testing, and to fix the deletes on the testing db.
